# REACT-EXPLAIN

This project is a deep documentation of how React work. It is a project where I will keep note and what I think I understand from React and my observation about it. I will go deeply in the internal code of React, so it will sometimes be very hard to understand unless you have a primary understand of how React is structured. This project is not for beginner at all.
